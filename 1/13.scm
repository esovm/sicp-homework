; Exercise 1.13.  Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to a^n/5, where a = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Hint: Let b = (1 - sqrt(5))/2. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see section 1.2.2) to prove that Fib(n) = (a^n - b^n)/sqrt(5).

; TODO: unsolved

; f(n) = (a^n - b^n)/sqrt(5)
; f(n) = ( ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 )^n - ( (1 - sqrt(5) )/2 )^n ) / sqrt(5)
